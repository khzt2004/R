# Suggestions for the student:
# Suppose your client is someone other than the local farmer,
# a meat producer/butcher, dairy, or brewer perhaps.
# Determine association rules relevant to your client's products
# guided by the market basket model. What recommendations
# would you make about future marketplace actions?
