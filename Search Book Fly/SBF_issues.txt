Potential Roadblocks:

Must provide data in the same format from BQ - queries can be replicated to some extent if client definitions are provided

search/booking lead days - need it as a CD otherwise need to calculate manually

Features:
we can segment data by:
device
searched market (depends on CD in GA)


Custom attribution data:
Just obtain filterCombineDataFinal dataframe

Interpretation:
Channel [X] tends to appear earlier/later in the path to conversion
